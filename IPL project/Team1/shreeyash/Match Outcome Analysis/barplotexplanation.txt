Explanation of the Code:

1. Melt the DataFrame:
----------------------
all_matches = pd.melt(matches_df, id_vars=['season', 'winner'], value_vars=['team1', 'team2'], var_name='team_type', value_name='team')

- What is happening here?
  - Imagine you have a table with columns for the season, the two teams that played, and the winner.
  - We want to create a new table where each row represents a team that played in a match, along with the season and the winner.
  - The 'pd.melt' function helps us do this by "melting" the 'team1' and 'team2' columns into a single column called 'team'.

2. Mark Losses:
---------------
all_matches['loss'] = all_matches.apply(lambda row: row['team'] != row['winner'], axis=1)

- What is happening here?
  - We want to know if a team lost a match.
  - We create a new column called 'loss'.
  - For each row (which represents a team in a match), we check if the team is not the winner.
  - If the team is not the winner, we mark it as a loss ('True'). If the team is the winner, we mark it as not a loss ('False').

3. Calculate Losses per Season:
-------------------------------
losses_per_season = all_matches[all_matches['loss']].groupby(['season', 'team']).size().reset_index(name='losses')

- What is happening here?
  - We want to count the number of losses for each team in each season.
  - We filter the table to keep only the rows where the team lost ('all_matches[all_matches['loss']]').
  - We group the data by season and team.
  - We count the number of losses for each team in each season.
  - We create a new table with columns for season, team, and the number of losses.
